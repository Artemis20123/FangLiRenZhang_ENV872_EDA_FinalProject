To explore the data, we wanted to create a visualization of the monthly
PM2.5 for the cities from 2000 to 2021. The data was first filtered to
include only the seven cities of interest. Then we grouped the data by
city, year, and month and summarized the mean PM2.5 value for each
month. A monthly PM2.5 line plot was created for each city using
ggplot2.
\includegraphics{LiFangRenZhang_ENV872_Project_files/figure-latex/TSA Visualization-1.pdf}
The plot showed that Beijing and Tianjin had the highest PM2.5 values
among the seven cities, and Shenzhen had the lowest values. Most of the
cities seemed to have a slow increase in PM2.5 from 2000 to 2006, then
stayed relatively constant from 2006 until 2014. In 2014, most cities
had a spike in PM2.5. From 2014, PM2.5 in all cities showed a decreasing
trend. To better understand the changes in PM2.5, we conducted
time-series analysis and predicted the monthly PM2.5 for the seven
cities from 2022 to 2026.

\subsubsection{Seven cities monthly PM2.5
(2000\textasciitilde2021)}\label{seven-cities-monthly-pm2.5-20002021}}

Using the STL function, we decomposed the PM2.5 time series data of the
target cities into seasonal and trend components and performed a
comparative analysis. The PM2.5 values in these cities are generally
lower during the summer months (June, July, August, and September) and
higher during the winter months (November, December, January, and
February) (Figure 2). There are several possible factors contributing to
this seasonality: First, In the summer, temperatures are higher, leading
to more active air convection, which facilitates the dispersion and
dissipation of pollutants in the air. Secondly, there tends to be more
rainfall in the summer, which can wash PM2.5 particles from the
atmosphere to the ground, reducing their measured values. Thirdly, in
the winter, heating demand increases, and in some areas, coal combustion
remains the primary method of providing heat. This leads to increased
emissions of coal-related pollutants, causing a rise in PM2.5 levels.

The trend results for the target cities are consistent with those
observed in the exploratory analysis (Figure 3). Notably, around 2014
marked a turning point when PM2.5 levels in major cities began to
decrease gradually. This shift is likely attributed to the Chinese
government's implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control
Action Plan, released in September 2013. This plan was the first time
the Chinese government set explicit air quality improvement targets. It
required that, by 2017, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in cities
at or above the prefectural level should be reduced by more than 10\%.
In key regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta,
and the Pearl River Delta, the plan aimed for reductions of 25\%, 20\%,
and 15\%, respectively.

To better visualize the data, we created a dashboard using Shiny. The
dashboard consisted of three side panels:``PM2.5 National
Distribution'', ``Time Series Visualization by City'', ``PM2.5
Prediction by City'' and three corresponding tab panels: ``Map'',
``TSA'', and ``Prediction''.

The ``PM2.5 National Distribution'' allows users to drag the map in the
``Map'' tab and explore the PM2.5 distribution pattern in the country.
The ``Time Series Visualization by City'' panel has a dropdown box that
allows users to select the monthly PM2.5 visualization of each city. The
results are displayed in the ``TSA'' tab. Finally, the ``PM2.5
Prediction by City'' panel has a dropdown box and slider. Users can
select the city and the time range to view the monthly PM2.5 prediction
in the ``Prediction'' tab.
